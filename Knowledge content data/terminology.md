# Terminology

## Above Threshold Benefit (ATB)

The Above Threshold Benefit (ATB) gives you extra cover when your claims add up to a set amount called the Annual Threshold, if you are on an Executive, Comprehensive or Priority plan.

Once all the claims you have sent to us add up to the Annual Threshold, we pay the rest of your claims from the Above Threshold Benefit (ATB), at the Discovery Health Rate (DHR) or a portion of it. The Executive and Comprehensive plans have an unlimited Above Threshold Benefit (ATB), and the Priority plans have a limited ATB.

We count a maximum of three children when we work out the Annual Threshold and Above Threshold Benefit limit, except when a child has been placed in the custody of a member, such as foster care, in which case every child on the membership will be counted.

If you join the medical scheme after January, you won’t get the full amount because it is calculated by counting the remaining months in the year.

## Additional Disease List (ADL)

The Additional Disease List (ADL) is an additional list of life-threatening or degenerative conditions, as defined by us, you are covered for these conditions' medicine once you are approved on the Chronic Illness Benefit (CIB). Once approved on the Chronic Illness Benefit (CIB), you have cover for medicine for additional diseases that we cover over and above the 27 chronic conditions if you're on our Executive or Comprehensive plans. The conditions are:

Ankylosing spondylitis, Behçet's disease, cystic fibrosis, delusional disorder, dermatopolymyositis, generalised anxiety disorder, Huntington's disease, major depression, muscular dystrophy and other inherited myopathies, myasthenia gravis, obsessive compulsive disorder, osteoporosis, isolated growth hormone deficiency, motor neuron disease, Paget's disease, panic disorder, polyarteritis nodosa, post-traumatic stress disorder, psoriatic arthritis, pulmonary intestinal fibrosis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, Wegener's granulomatosis.

## Annual Threshold

We add up the Discovery Health Rate of the day-to-day claims you send us. When your day-to-day claims reach a fixed rand amount - what we call the Annual Threshold - we pay claims from the Above Threshold Benefit, if you are on an Executive, Comprehensive or Priority plan. We set the Annual Threshold amount at the beginning of each year. The number and type of dependants (adult or spouse or child) on your plan will also determine the amount. The Annual Threshold is an amount that your claims need to add up to before we pay your day-to-day claims from the Above Threshold Benefit (ATB). 

## Chronic Disease List (CDL)

Chronic conditions are defined as conditions that last 1 year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living or both. 

The Chronic Disease List (CDL) is a defined list of chronic conditions we cover according to the Prescribed Minimum Benefits (PMBs). The conditions are:

Addison's disease, asthma, bipolar mood disorder, bronchiectasis, cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease, coronary artery disease, Crohn's disease, diabetes insipidus, diabetes Type 1, diabetes Type 2, dysrhythmia, epilepsy, glaucoma, haemophilia, HIV, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis

## Chronic Illness Benefit (CIB)

The Chronic Illness Benefit (CIB) covers you for a defined list of chronic conditions. You need to apply to have your medicine covered for your chronic condition.

All our plans cover approved medicine for the Prescribed Minimum Benefit Chronic Disease List conditions. Certain plans cover additional conditions.

### Prescribed Minimum Benefit (PMB) conditions

You have access to treatment for a list of medical conditions under the Prescribed Minimum Benefits (PMBs). The PMBs cover the 27 chronic conditions on the Chronic Disease List (CDL). All our plans offer benefits that are far richer than the PMBs. To access PMBs, certain rules apply (see Prescribed Minimum Benefits).

### Medicine cover for the Chronic Disease List

You get full cover for approved chronic medicine on our medicine list. For medicine not on our list, we cover you up to a set monthly rand amount called the Chronic Drug Amount (CDA). The CDA does not apply to the Smart and KeyCare plans. On these plans you will have to pay for medicine that is not on the medicine list.

### Medicine cover for the Additional Disease List

The Executive and Comprehensive plans offer cover for medicine on the Additional Disease List (ADL). You are covered up to the set monthly CDA for your medicine. No medicine list applies.

### Extended chronic medicine list

Members on the Executive Plan also have full cover for an exclusive list of brand medicines.

### How we pay for medicine

We pay for medicine up to a maximum of the Discovery Health Rate for medicine. The Discovery Health Rate for medicine is the price of the medicine as well.

### What is the Chronic Disease List and its conditions?

The Chronic Disease List (CDL) is a defined list of chronic conditions we cover according to the Prescribed Minimum Benefits (PMBs). The conditions are:

Addison's disease, asthma, bipolar mood disorder, bronchiectasis, cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease, coronary artery disease, Crohn's disease, diabetes insipidus, diabetes Type 1, diabetes Type 2, dysrhythmia, epilepsy, glaucoma, haemophilia, HIV, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, hypothyroidism, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis

## Connected Care

Connected care provides access to remote care at home, including a Home Monitoring Device Benefit for essential home monitoring, home-based hospital related care and follow-up treatment after an admission and access to Hospital at Home progamme for quality care in the comfort of your own home. 

## Contribution

This is the monthly amount you pay for your cover for medical costs.

We count a maximum of three children when we work out the monthly contribution and annual Medical Savings Account, except when a child has been placed in the custody of a member, such as foster care, in which case every child on the membership will be counted.

## Co-payment

The Co-payment is an amount that you need to pay towards a healthcare service. The amount can vary by the type of covered healthcare service, place of service or if the amount the service provider charges is higher than the rate we cover. If the co-payment amount is higher than the amount charged for the healthcare service, you will have to pay for the cost of the healthcare service.

## Cover

Cover refers to the benefits you have access to and how we pay for these healthcare services such as consultations, medicine and hospitals, on your health plan.

## Day-to-day Extender Benefit (DEB)
On the Executive, Comprehensive, Priority and Saver Plans we extend your day-to-day cover through the Day-to-day Extender Benefit (DEB) when you have spent your annual Medical Savings Account allocation and before you reach your Annual Threshold, where applicable for GP consultation fees and kids casualty visits. Cover depends on the plan you choose.

Day-to-day Extender Benefit (DEB) extends your day-to-day cover for essential healthcare services in our network if you have spent your annual Medical Savings Account (MSA) allocation and before you reach the Annual Threshold.

## Deductible

A Deductible is the amount that you must pay upfront to the hospital or day clinic for specific treatments/procedures or if you use a facility outside of the network. If the upfront amount is higher than the amount charged for the healthcare service, you will have to pay for the cost of the healthcare service. 

## Delta Hospital Network

If you are on a Delta plan, this is a network of specific hospitals you must use for planned procedures to be covered.

## Designated Service Provider (DSP)

A designated service provider is a healthcare provider (such as a doctor, specialist, allied healthcare professional, pharmacist or hospital) that is a medical scheme's first choice when members need diagnosis, treatment or care for a Prescribed Minimum Benefit condition. They are the healthcare providers who we have an agreement with to provide treatment or services at a contracted rate.

If you choose not to use a designated service provider, you may have to pay a portion of the bill yourself. This could either be a percentage co-payment or the difference between the Discovery Health Rate and that charged by the healthcare provider you used.

## Discovery Health Rate (DHR)

This is a rate set by us at which healthcare services from hospitals, pharmacies and healthcare professionals are paid.

For claims paid at Cost we pay your claims in full at the claimed amount. We pay medicine claims up to a maximum of the Discovery Health Rate for medicines. If you are on a plan with an Above Threshold Benefit (ATB), then we add up claims to the Annual Threshold up to the Discovery Health Rate and not Cost. This can increase your Self-payment Gap. If the healthcare professional charges more than the Discovery Health Rate and is not part of a direct payment arrangement, we will pay you.

### Discovery Health Rate for medicine

Discovery Health Rate for medicine is the rate we pay for medicine. It is the Single Exit Price of medicine plus the relevant dispensing fee.

## Discovery Home Care

Discovery Home Care is an additional service that offers you quality home-based care in the comfort of your home for healthcare services like IV infusions, wound care, post-natal care and advanced illness care.

## Healthcare professional

Healthcare professionals are individuals who provide preventive, curative, promotional or rehabilitative healthcare services to people, families or communities. These include general practitioners (GPs), specialists, nurses, physiotherapists, psychologists, dentists, pathologists and radiologists.

## HealthID

HealthID is an online digital platform that gives your doctor fast, up-to-date access to your health information. Once you have given consent, your doctor can use HealthID to access your medical history, make referrals to other healthcare professionals and check your relevant test results.

## KeyCare Hospital Network

If you are on a KeyCare plan, this is a network of specific providers, both in hospital and out of hospital, which you must use in order to be covered.

## Limits

Most in-hospital and out-of-hospital healthcare benefits do not have an upper limit, but some healthcare services, such as dentistry and optometry, have yearly limits that apply. It's important to familiarise yourself with these limits and to keep track of your use of them. Discovery Health Medical Scheme members can do this by logging in to the Discovery website.

## Medical Savings Account (MSA)

On the Executive, Comprehensive, Priority and Saver plans, the Medical Savings Account (MSA) is an amount that is allocated to you at the beginning of each year or when you join the Scheme. You pay this amount back in equal portions as part of your monthly contribution. We pay your day-to-day medical expenses such as GP and specialist consultations, acute medicine, radiology and pathology from the available funds allocated to your MSA. Any unused funds will carry over to the next year. If you join the medical scheme after January, you won’t get the full amount because it is calculated by counting the remaining months in the year.

Should you leave the Scheme or change your plan partway through the year and have used more of the funds than what you have contributed, you will need to pay the difference to us. If you leave Discovery Health Medical Scheme, we are legally required to pay the balance to the new medical scheme you join. If that information is not available or you choose a plan without a medical savings account, then we pay you whatever you have contributed that is more than you have claimed, after four months.

We count a maximum of three children when we work out the annual Medical Savings Account, except when a child has been placed in the custody of a member, such as foster care, in which case every child on the membership will be counted.

## Medicine list or formulary

This is a list of approved medicine we pay for in full. This list includes an extensive range of high-quality medicine to make sure you always have the option of full cover.

### What if I suffer side effects from medicine on the formulary?

If this happens, or if substituting your current medicine with medicine on the formulary has a negative effect on your health, you and your doctor can put your case to us and ask us to pay for your medicine.

## Prescribed Minimum Benefits (PMBs)

In terms of the Medical Schemes Act of 1998 (Act No. 131 of 1998) and its Regulations, all medical schemes have to cover the costs related to the diagnosis, treatment and care of:

* An emergency medical condition
* A defined list of 270 diagnoses
* A defined list of 26 chronic conditions

To access Prescribed Minimum Benefits (PMBs), there are rules that apply:

* Your medical condition must qualify for cover and be part of the defined list of Prescribed Minimum Benefit (PMB) conditions.
* The treatment needed must match the treatments in the defined benefits.
* You must use designated service providers (DSPs) in our network. This does not apply in emergencies. However even in these cases, where appropriate and according to the rules of the Scheme, you may be transferred to a hospital or other service providers in our network, once your condition has stabilised.

If your treatment doesn't meet the above criteria, we will pay up to 80% of the Discovery Health Rate. You will be responsible for the difference between what we pay and the actual cost of your treatment.

### What is an emergency

An emergency medical condition, also referred to as an emergency, is the sudden and, at the time unexpected onset of a health condition that requires immediate medical and surgical treatment, where failure to provide medical or surgical treatment would result in serious impairment to bodily functions or serious dysfunction of a bodily organ or part or would place the person's life in serious jeopardy. An emergency does not necessarily require a hospital admission. We may ask you for additional information to confirm the emergency.

For more information, read our Guide to Prescribed Minimum Benefits, Prescribed Minimum Benefit treatment guidelines, Guide to Prescribed Minimum Benefits for in-hospital treatment and Prescribed Minimum Benefit list of conditions.

## Related accounts

A related account is any account other than the hospital account for in-hospital care. This could include the accounts for the admitting doctor, anaesthetist and any approved healthcare expenses like radiology or pathology.

## Self-payment Gap (SPG)

The Self-payment Gap (SPG) is applicable to plans that have a Medical Savings Account, and refers to a temporary gap in cover when you run out of funds in your Medical Savings Account but have not yet reached your Annual Threshold.

You must still send claims to us so that we know when to start paying from your Above Threshold Benefit (ATB).

## Screening and prevention benefit
